#  | is a pipe operator that uses the output of the previous command as input for the next command.
# grep is used to search and return lines in files that match a specified search pattern.
   # -o causes grep to display only the matching parts, not the entire line.
   # -p '' activates the Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) mode of grep. It supports commands like you where programing in Pearl.
   # (?<=Envelope) means that the match must occur before the text "Envelope", but "Envelope" itself is not included in the match.
   # .*? is used to search for the first occurrence of a pattern surrounded by other text without capturing the longest possible match range.
   # .*? means that the regular expression tries to match as little as possible by accepting zero or more occurrences of any character (except a newline)
      # . Match any character except a line break
